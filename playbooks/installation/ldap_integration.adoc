The OpenShift Container Platform provides support for leveraging users and groups stored in an Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) V3 server using simple bind authentication. 

The official OpenShift documentation provides a high level overview for authenticating a user against an LDAP server:

[quote, Configuring Authentication and User Agent, https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/configuring_authentication.html]
_________________________________________________
During authentication, the LDAP directory is searched for an entry that matches the provided user name. If a single unique match is found, a simple bind is attempted using the distinguished name (DN) of the entry plus the provided password.
_________________________________________________

== LDAP Users and their Access to OpenShift

Once it has been determined that access to OpenShift will be governed by users defined in an LDAP server, the next step is to determine the criteria for determining a valid user. Common use cases are listed below:

* A user exists either at the same level or underneath a particular location of the LDAP tree (known as a base DN)
* A user must be a member of a particular LDAP group

NOTE: The conditions above assume the user has provided valid credentials

=== Example LDAP Tree Structure

The organization and structure of objects in an LDAP server is critical for its interaction with OpenShift. The following is an example of an LDAP structure that will be used for the rest of the discussion:

[source,ldap]
----
+ dc=example,dc=com # domain/organization
  + dn: ou=Users,dc=myorg,dc=com 
    + dn: uid=jdoe,ou=Users,dc=myorg,dc=com
      cn: jdoe
      givenName: John Doe
      mail: jdoe@myorg.com
      member: uid=admins,ou=Groups,dc=myorg,dc=com
      member: uid=openshift,ou=Groups,dc=myorg,dc=com
      phone: 919-555-1234
      uid: jdoe
    + dn: uid=csmith,ou=Users,dc=myorg,dc=com
      cn: csmith
      uid: csmith
      mail: csmith@redhat.com
      member: uid=openshift,ou=Groups,dc=myorg,dc=com
      givenName: Chris Smith
      phone: 919-555-4321
  + dn: ou=Groups,dc=myorg,dc=com
    + dn: uid=admins,ou=Groups,dc=myorg,dc=com
      member: uid=jdoe,ou=Users,dc=myorg,dc=com 
    + dn: uid=openshift,ou=Groups,dc=myorg,dc=com
      member: uid=jdoe,ou=Users,dc=myorg,dc=com
      member: uid=csmith,ou=Users,dc=myorg,dc=com
----

Two primary organizational units (OU) are defined within the `myorg.com` domain (`ou=Users,dc=myorg,dc=com` and `dn: ou=Groups,dc=myorg,dc=com`). This example represents a flat hierarchy where all users within the organization are contained within the _Users_ OU and all groups are contained within the _Groups_ OU. 


== Configure OpenShift to use LDAP for User Authentication

To configure OpenShift to restrict access to the platform based on users managed in an LDAP server, an Identity Provider leveraging the `LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider` must be configured.  The following information must be available to configure LDAP based authentication:

1. Username (referred to Bind DN) and password (referred to Bind Password) of a user that has access to traverse the LDAP tree (if anonymous access disabled)
2. Protocol, hostname and port of the LDAP server
3. CA bundle of the LDAP server (if secured. It is recommended that communication occur over a secure connection)
4. Base DN location for which users will be searched
5. Additional filtering logic, such as the scope of the user query and a filter (optional)

The `LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider` provider can be configured either by editing the OpenShift master configuration file located at `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` or through the Ansible based installer. 

=== The LDAP Identity Provider

Based on the previous LDAP tree structure, to allow any authenticated user from the set of users defined in the `ou=Users,dc=myorg,dc=com` OU, specify the following Identity Provider configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
  identityProviders:
  - name: "my_ldap_provider" 
    challenge: true 
    login: true 
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider <1>
      attributes:
        id: 
        - dn <2>
        email: 
        - mail <3>
        name: 
        - cn  <4>
        preferredUsername: 
        - uid <5>
      bindDN: "" <6>
      bindPassword: "" <7>
      ca: my-ldap-ca-bundle.crt <8>
      insecure: false <9>
      url: "ldaps://ldap.example.com/ou=Users,dc=myorg,dc=com?uid" <10>
----
<1> The name of the LDAP Identity Provider
<2> The LDAP field of the user to use as the unique identifier within OpenShift
<3> The LDAP field of the user to use as their email address
<4> The LDAP field of the user to use as their friendly name
<5> The LDAP field of the user to use as their user name when logging into OpenShift
<6> The distinguished name (DN) of the user used to traverse the LDAP tree and validate users
<7> The Password of the user used to traverse the LDAP tree to validate users. This value may also be provided in an link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/master_node_configuration.html#master-node-configuration-passwords-and-other-data[environment variable, external file, or encrypted file].
<8> If communicating securely and the certificate is not in the system trust store, the location of the CA bundle
<9> Whether to communicates securely with the LDAP server (true by default)
<10> RFC 2255 based URL specifying the host and search parameters. 

NOTE: If anonymous bind access is enabled, the `bindDN` and `bindPassword` options can be set as `""` 

In the example above, the _url_ parameter specifies that the query connect securely to the LDAP server on 636 (389 if not connecting securely). The baseDN which indicates where all searches should start from is specified after the `/`. _uid_ references the LDAP attribute that should be used to match username provided by the user attempting to log in. 

Another option is to add a filter to the query in which to further limit the users that are allowed to authenticate to OpenShift. To limit only user who are members of the _openshift_ group, the `(member=uid=admins,ou=Groups,dc=myorg,dc=com)` can be applied which results in a _url_ represented as `url: "ldaps://ldap.myorg.com/ou=Users,dc=myorg,dc=com?uid?(member=uid=admins,ou=Groups,dc=myorg,dc=com)`.


=== OpenShift Ansible Configuration

The Ansible based OpenShift installer contains functionality to automate the configuration of the `LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider`. Several link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-cluster-variables[cluster variables] of the Ansible link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-ansible[inventory] can be specified to tune the configuration of identity providers. For LDAP, these include:

* `openshift_master_identity_providers` - An array of identity providers to configure within the OpenShift master configuration file
* `openshift_master_ldap_ca` - Text value of the LDAP CA
* `openshift_master_ldap_ca_file` - Location of the LDAP CA file on the Ansible control host. This file will be copied to the OpenShift master configuration directory (`/etc/origin/master`)

The following can be added to the `[OSEv3:vars]` section of the OpenShift inventory file to configure the `LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider` for the LDAP structure referenced above. 

[source,yaml]
----
[OSEv3:vars]
...
openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'my_ldap_provider', 'challenge': 'true', 'login': 'true', 'kind': 'LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider', 'attributes': {'id': ['dn'], 'email': ['mail'], 'name': ['cn'], 'preferredUsername': ['uid']}, 'bindDN': '', 'bindPassword': '', 'ca': 'my-ldap-ca-bundle.crt', 'insecure': 'false', 'url': 'ldap://ldap.myorg.com:389/uid=users,dc=myorg,dc=com?uid'}]
openshift_master_ldap_ca_file=/home/myuser/my-ldap-ca-bundle.crt
...
----

Run the `ansible-playbook` command referencing the inventory file and playbook which will be used to apply the changes to the cluster.

[source,yaml]
----
ansible-playbook -i c1-ocp.myorg.com/hosts /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
----

=== Manual Configuration 

Instead of using Ansible, the `LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider` can be configured manually by modifying the OpenShift master configuration file located at `/etc/orgin/master/master-config.yaml`

Locate the _identityProviders_ section of the OpenShift master configuration located at `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` and configure the section with the value provided in the previous section.

Once complete, restart the `atomic-openshift-master-api` (or `atomic-openshift-master` if running a single master) service to apply and enable the changes

[source,bash]
----
systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
----

IMPORTANT: These configurations must be applied on each master instance


== Testing LDAP queries

As part of the configuring OpenShift to make use of an LDAP server, it may be helpful to manually connect and perform queries against the server in order to validate the configurations. 

There are several tools available that allow for browsing an LDAP server:

* ldapsearch - Linux based command line query tool
* link:http://jxplorer.org/[JXplorer] - Cross platform LDAP browser and editor

=== ldapsearch

To make use of the _ldapsearch_ tool, first ensure that it is installed on the local machine:

[source,bash]
----
yum install -y openldap-clients -y
----

==== Common Use Cases

Common use cases for using the _ldapsearch_ tool include searching for users, groups and members within a group. The following are examples of each of these queries:

* Search for a user

[source,bash]
----
ldapsearch -h ldap.myorg.com -p 636 -x -s base -b uid=jdoe,ou=Users,dc=myorg,dc=com
----


* Search for groups

[source,bash]
----
ldapsearch -h ldap.example.com -p 636 -x -s sub -b "ou=Groups,dc=myorg,dc=com" "objectClass: groupOfUniqueNames"
----


* Get members of a group

[source,bash]
----
ldapsearch -h ldap.myorg.com -p 636 -x -s base -b "uid=openshift,ou=Groups,dc=myorg,dc=com" "member"
----

In each of the above queries, the following signify the parameters being specified:

* -h - The LDAP Host
* -p - The LDAP port
* -x - Perform a simple bind
* -Z - Connect via TLS
* -b - Base DN where all queries should start from
* -s - Search scope of the query


==== Common Issues

When using _ldapsearch_, issues can arise that affect the operation and expected results.


* _TLS: can't accept: TLS error -12195:Peer does not recognize and trust the CA that issued your certificate.._

The CA to a secure LDAP server is not currently trusted by _ldapsearch_. Modify the `/etc/openldap/ldap.conf` file to include either a directory containing the certificates or a certificate bundle file

[source,bash]
----
TLS_CACERTDIR   /etc/openldap/certs <1>
TLS_CACERT      /etc/openldap/certs/ca.cert.pem <2>
----
<1> Directory containing certificates
<2> Location of the CA bundle
