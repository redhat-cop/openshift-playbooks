Paas & Container technologies are often very closely tied with DevOps. In fact, we often confuse the adoption of "next-gen" technology stacks like OpenShift with "DevOps adoption". While it's true that certain automation and cloud technologies fit very nicely into a DevOps frame of mind, it's important to understand that employing DevOps means much more than just having the right technology, or writing automation scripts. DevOps is at its core a philosophy and a mindset that revolves around taking _lean manufacturing_ principles and applying them to an IT organization. DevOps is first and foremost about providing value to your Business through technology, but technology alone can't get you there.

To that end, we have compiled a reading list to get you familiar with this philosophy and the principles of DevOps. Check back often for more resources or additional articles we will write in the future.
