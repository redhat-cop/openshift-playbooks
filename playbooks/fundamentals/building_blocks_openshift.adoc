== Concepts & Terminology

* Containers
  ** A _container_ is an operating system level construct that allows for the running of isolated software systems within a single OS
* Images
  ** An _image_ is a portable package containing all content, binaries, and configuration data that define a container instance
* Pods
  ** A _pod_ is a wrapper around one or more containers which adds a networking & configuration layer for managing containers across hosts
* Replication
  ** _Replication_ is the act of instantiating multiple copies of a pod definition in order to provide multiple instances of a runtime environment
  ** Managed by a _replication controler_
  ** Accomplished by re-instantiating a container image
* Services
  ** A _service_ is a set of replicated pods.
* Routes
  ** A _route_ is a load balancing mechanism used to expose services externally
* Projects
  ** A _project_ is an isolation mechanism used to provide users ability to create resources while keeping them separate and secure from other OpenShift users
  ** Wraps around Kubernetes _namespace_
* Labels and Selectors
  ** A _label_ is a key-pair value tag that can be applied to most resources in OpenShift to give extra meaning or context to that resource for later filtering for selecting.
  ** A _selector_ is a parameter used by many resources in OpenShift to associate a resource with another resource by specifying a label.
  ** _Labels_ and _Selectors_ can be used to:
    *** Assign certain projects, services, pods to run on a certain set of nodes
    *** Create regions, zones and other network topology constructs
    *** Assign pods to services
    *** Assign a router to a certain set of projects (perhaps internal/external apps)
    *** Much more...
* Builds and Deployments
  ** A _build_ in OpenShift is the process by which application content, code, or packages are build into a container image (we call this an application image)
  ** A _deployment_ in OpenShift is the process of instantiating an application image to create running containers/pods running the application

== Implementation: Components of OpenShift

* Master
  ** Components:
    *** API/authentication
    *** Scheduler
    *** Management/replication
    *** Data store (etcd)
    *** Web console
  ** Responsible for:
    *** Manage authentication and authorization
    *** Manage the state of the cluster
* Nodes
  ** Hosting workloads
  ** Achieved through:
    *** Pods
    *** Containers
    *** Kubeproxy
    *** Kubelet
    *** iptables
* OpenShift Image Registry
  ** Containerized docker registry + namespace isolation & security context constraints built in
  ** Pretty much required for OSE
* OpenShift SDN
  ** Internal private network (IPs not visible outside OpenShift)
  ** Currently OpenVSwitch implementation
    *** UDP-based physical
    *** Extra header added to packet
  ** Used for pod to pod communication
  ** Multi-tenant (project based VXLAN network isolation)
* Service Layer
  ** Provides *internal* communication between application components in OpenShift
  ** Service
    *** A _service_ is a set of replicated pods.
    *** Generally used to define a consumable application function (e.g. a database or microservice)
    *** Pods are grouped into a service
    *** A service has a dedicated IP address
  ** Service Layer Example:

* Routing Layer
  ** Provides *external* access to OpenShift Services
  ** Routers
    *** A _router_ is a special service within OpenShift that Load Balances to external traffic to internal services
    *** Listens on port 80/443 on the node host
    *** HAProxy based
    *** Supports scale up for HA
    *** Can have multiple routers for "regional" routing
  ** Routes
    *** A _route_ is the mapping of an individual service to an external address (hostname)
    *** Requires a hostname and a service name at minimum
    *** Optional support for TLS termincation, including unique certificates
  ** Routing Layer Example:
