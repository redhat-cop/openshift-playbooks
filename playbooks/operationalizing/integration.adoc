To Integrate Third Party application with OpenShift requires that you configure the application/service to make calls against the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/rest_api/openshift_v1.html[OpenShift] and https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/rest_api/kubernetes_v1.html[Kubernetes] REST APIs. The following document provides resources and tips on how to accomplish this.

== Authentication

There are two methods by which to Authenticate to the OpenShift API.

* Oauth Access Tokens
* X.509 Client Certificates

Both concepts are explained further https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#api-authentication[here].

=== Tokens

OAuth Tokens can be generated in one of two ways:

1. Through the *oc* client:
----
oc whoami -t
----

[start=2]
2. Requesting a Token directly from the API:
----
curl -u username:password -k https://master.openshift.example.com:8443/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=openshift-challenging-client
----

== Basic API Request

An API Request to OpenShift contains several components:

* Authentication Header: `Authentication Bearer: <token>`
* Content-type Header: `Content-Type: application/json`
* HTTP Method: `{GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE}`
* API URL: `master.ose.example.com:8443`
* Path ``/<api>/<version>/`
** The Kubernetes API path is `/api/v1/`
** The OpenShift API path is `/oapi/v1/`

All put together, a command line API request might look something like:
----
curl -kI -H "Authentication Bearer: <token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET https://master.ose.example.com:8443/oapi/v1/projects
----

=== Client Certificates

Like the *Basic API Request* a client certificate request, contains the following components:

* Identitiy certificate and key: `/etc/origin/master/admin.crt and /etc/origin/master/admin.key`
* Content-type Header: `Content-Type: application/json`
* HTTP Method: `{GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE}`
* API URL: `master.ose.example.com:8443`
* Path ``/<api>/<version>/`
** The Kubernetes API path is `/api/v1/`
** The OpenShift API path is `/oapi/v1/`

It should be noted, that the *Authentication Header* is missing from the list above and replaced by a "certificate" and "key".

When building an API call in this form, its best to use an https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/admin_guide/allocating_node_resources.html#system-resources-reported-by-node[example] that shows / highlights actual data, like the stats endpoint for a node.

* Note: You need to replace NODE_NAME with a valid node name from `oc get nodes`.

----
# curl -E /etc/origin/master/admin.crt --key /etc/origin/master/admin.key https://master.ose.example.com:8443/api/v1/nodes/<NODE_NAME>/proxy/stats/summary
----

== Traversing the API

The OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs use http://swagger.io/[Swagger] to provide Schemas and visualizations of the APIs.

=== Schema

The JSON schema doc for OpenShift can be pulled from any Master:
----
https://master.ose.example.com:8443/swaggerapi/oapi/v1/
----

=== Visualizing the API

Swagger UI can also be used to visualize the API. Andy Block has a very useful http://blog.andyserver.com/2015/09/openshift-api-swagger/[blog post] on that.

=== Testing in the Command Line

Here is an {scripts_repo}/blob/openshift-enterprise-3/ose-api-toolset.md[OSE v3 Toolkit] to get people started on testing API Requests in the command line.

== Reverse Engineering OpenShift Client API Calls

OpenShift v3 runs completely through its APIs. As such, it's fairly simple to actually use the OpenShit CLI and Web UI tools to break down and build out API Request automation used for various action items in openshift.

=== Using the CLI

You can bump up the log levels in the `oc` CLI utility to show the API requests made by each command:
----
oc deploy myapp -n myproject --loglevel=8
----

==== Using the Console

Both Firefox and Google chrome contain a "Network" debugger that will display requests made by the web client back to the server. You can use this tool to break down API requests made by the console.
