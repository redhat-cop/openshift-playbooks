== What is a Delivery Playbook?

A _delivery playbook_ is a guide for implementing DevOps technical practices and container automation approaches using Red Hat commercial open source products, including OpenShift Container Platform 3. Playbooks are intended to reflect real-world experience delivering solutions through these processes and technologies.

== Delivery Playbook Components

=== Presenter Guide

_As a Presenter, I want to have Documentation available to me which allows me to present a Demo of a particular solution in a canned environment._

==== Guidelines for Presenter Guides

A good Presenter Guide should…

* List prerequisite knowledge needed to understand the demo material, including resource links to help a presenter ramp up.
* Contain all execution steps needed to step through a successful demo
* Include some presenter notes that call out things to highlight, subject matter to cover

=== Implementer Guide

_As an Implementer, I want to have Documentation available to me which enables me to go and implement a particular solution in my own environment._

==== Guidelines for an Implementor Guide

A good Implementer Guide should…

* Document Assumptions and Prerequisites
* Be Flexible - Call out options for alternate or customized approaches
* Be Specific - Include steps and code examples
* Be Opinionated - Don’t want to shy away from giving recommendations just because the approach may change later
* Should not overwrite docs - Complement and reference official documentation whenever possible
* Include diagrams where relevant
* Make it appropriate for Public eye

== Notes

* Playbooks may in the future be turned into Enablement material... think about how this could be turned into exercises
